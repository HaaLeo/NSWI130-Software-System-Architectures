# Temperature Regulation

The temperature regulation system needs to regulate the temperature of all rooms of the hospital. This means each room can have different target temperatures (patients room vs. operation room). The system should automatically set the temperature of a room to a previously specified _target temperature_. Further the system should allow people to interact with it and specify a target temperature. Afterwards the system will control the air conditioner of the room in order to reach this temperature.
